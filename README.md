# heartdisease prediction using machine learning
In this project, I've dealt with the Heart disease prediction dataset and various features like resting blood pressure, chest pain type, Number of major vessels, thallium stree, fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate etc were analyzed and  prediction was done to find whether the patient has heart disease or is normal.

It is a Classification problem with input features as numerical and categorical data and target as binary variable with '0' as no heart disease present and '1' as heart disease present

This project data set has records of 180 patients with different health conditions and whether that patient has heart disease or not. These records were analyzed using proper data processing and then different machine learning algorithms were applied and trained. Using these models, Predictions were made.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Naive-Bayes, XGBoost
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
6. K-nearest neighbours
7. K-Means

Conclusion:
Accuracy achieved: 0.93(Decision Tree Algorithm)
